# 📚 Personal Library – MiduDev Tech Challenge

This project is a **technical test proposed by MiduDev**, where the goal is to create a small personal library interface using React.

It simulates a book management system where users can:

- 📥 Add books from the **Available List** to a **Wishlist**
- ♻️ Remove books from the Wishlist and return them to the Available List
- 🧠 Use **localStorage** to **persist data across sessions**
- 📱 Enjoy a responsive layout suitable for **multiple screen sizes**

## 🛠️ Built With

- ⚛️ [React 19](https://reactjs.org/)
- 💅 [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) for component-scoped styling
- ⚡ [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the development and build tool
- 🧪 ESLint for code quality and consistency

---

## 💾 Persistence with LocalStorage

The app uses `localStorage` to store:

- The list of **available books**
- The list of books in the **wishlist**

This means users can **close the browser and return later** without losing their selections. Data is preserved until manually removed.

---

## 📱 Responsive Design

The layout is fully responsive and adjusts between:

- Desktop screens
- Tablets
- Mobile devices

This is handled using **flex layouts** and media queries inside styled components.

```bash
npm install
```

```
